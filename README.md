RLE Compression and Decompression Tool
Very easy to use and does not require installation

How to use:



1): Download the file and double click it to run in the browser.

2):Enter the serialized number in the box and press the corresponding button to receive the result.

3): Enter the result in the unzip box and press the corresponding button compares the result value with the initial value to see if everything is correct.(optional)

4): The second file is to unpack numbers that were not serialized by this script, when you only have rle encoded numbers and works the same way as the main file, by means of boxes and buttons
